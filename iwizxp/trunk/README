Iwiz-xp
=======

If you've obtained this source package directly from the BerliOS subversion
repository, do the following in order to build iwiz:

1. gmake -f Makefile.cvs
   This will generate ./configure
2. run ./configure
3. run gmake
4. (optional) run doxygen to generate API documentation.

Don't run 'gmake install', yet.
