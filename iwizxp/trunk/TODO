==========
- JavaDoc fixes are required (plenty of TODOs etc.)
- There's something wrong in the way I handle and store Cables connection
  method. Problem exists in representation of ConnectionMethod as a whole.
  Clearification is neede for the usage of dialing destination and default
  gateway.
- Finish migrating ISPs
- Add support for LAN and ADSL (after connection method re-design)
- Use schema (xsd) validation on loaded XMLs
- Supply an elborated explenation regarding steps in the Wizard when asking
  something from the listener.
- Review debug prints. Currently they are pretty useless for debugging.
- Add external configuration for eberything's that's TODOed "from configuration"
  at the global repository (add a --config flag while we're at it).
